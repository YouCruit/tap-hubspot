# tap-hubspot

This is a [Singer](https://singer.io) tap that produces JSON-formatted data following the [Singer spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/SPEC.md).

## Fork details

This fork was created because the official tap hasn't been updated in a good while. Additional features has been added, for example 

- support for [Tickets](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/tickets/tickets-overview)
- the schema for custom properties has been flattened. Before you'd have a schema such as 'foo: { value: 'bar', updated: '...', updatedBy: '...' } and that was just bloat. This tap instead produces this schema for custom properties: `foo: 'bar'
- requirement for an oauth token has been removed - you should use a hubspot api key to access the api
